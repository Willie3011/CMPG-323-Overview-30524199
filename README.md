# Branching Strategies
## Project 1
  #### For this Project I won't be using any Branching strategies because this projectt is mostly about planning for the entire Semester and it does not include too much coding nor does it need any branching strategies.

## Project 2
  #### For Project 2 I am going to use the Master branch and the Develop branch since I will be starting a new Project project. The Develop and Master branch are gonna be working hand in hand as the main branch will be having the final project and the develop branch is where I will be coding and making new changes

## Project 3
  #### For Project 3 I am going to use the Feature, Release , and Master Branches as I am going to have to gain Access to my previous or another project to complete project 3, which means I am going to update an already available project, and since I can't just commit and push my updates to the main branch I might commit and push my updates to the Feature Branch. After completing all the features and update I am then going to commit and push everything that is final to the Release Branch
  
## Project 4
  #### Project 4 I am going to use the Feature, Release, and Master Branches, because this project is almost like a continuation of the prvious project and thus this project will be treated as a feature and once the project has been completed I am going to commit and push to merge everything with the Master branch 

## Project 5

  #### For this Project I will use the Master Branch only as there ain't any features that need a different branch.

# Repositories to be used

## Project 1
  
  Project 1 will use the CMPG 323-Overview which was created for the overview of the projects
  
## Project 2
   For Project 2 I will create and use the CMPG 323 Project 2 - 30524199 repository 
  
  
## Project 3
  
   For Project 3 I will create and use the CMPG 323 Project 3 - 30524199 repository
  
  
## Project 4
  
   For Project 4 I will create and use the CMPG 323 Project 4 - 30524199 repository

## Project 5
  
   For Project 5 I will create and use the CMPG 323 Project 5 - 30524199 repository
  
  
# Project And Repository Structure
  
### Since most of the information related to the work of all the projects to be done is on Project 1, I am planning on creating different Repositories and link those repositories to Project 1. That way I will not waste much time copying and pasting the information related to a project that I need to do
